### `$ whoami`
- A 19-year-old Linux user who lives in China, slowly making progress on interested things.

### `$ cat /sys/me/status`
- Maintaining several projects:
    - [A music player plugin for osu!lazer](https://github.com/MATRIX-feather/LLin)
    - [Minecraft server for *XiamoMC*](https://xiamomc.ink)
    - [Morph plugin for Paper servers](https://github.com/XiaMoZhiShi/FeatherMorph), and its [client mod](https://github.com/XiaMoZhiShi/FeatherMorphClient)
- Tired of *Ubuntu and GNOME*, planning to switch to *Windows* or a linux distro that focuses on CJK end-users-friendly like *Deepin*.
- My next OS *would probably* is Windows if Ubuntu or GNOME still not fixing their desktop experience.
- Hope can join *Deepin* after several years and make more people use Linux because it's easier to use.
